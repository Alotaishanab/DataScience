# Transfer Entropy Analysis in the Energy Sector

This repository contains the final project submission for **COMP0047: Data Science**, as part of the **MSc Artificial Intelligence and Data Engineering** program at UCL. The project investigates directional information flow in the energy sector using **Transfer Entropy (TE)** estimated via both discrete binning and $k$-nearest neighbors (kNN) methods.

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up and run the analysis:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Alotaishanab/DataScience.git
   cd DataScience
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate    # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the notebooks**:
   ```bash
   cd notebooks
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   Open the main notebook and run all cells sequentially to reproduce the results and figures.
